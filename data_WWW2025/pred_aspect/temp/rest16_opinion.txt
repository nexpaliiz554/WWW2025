it has great sushi and even better service .	2,3
the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .	4,5
i ' ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .	3,4
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .	3,4; 9,10
good food !	0,1
this is a great place to get a delicious meal .	3,4; 8,9
the staff is pretty friendly .	4,5
the onion rings are great !	4,5
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you . . . . . were not good .	3,4; 26,27
nice ambience , but highly overrated place .	5,6
worst service i ever had	0,1
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .	12,13
our waiter was non - existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .	5,6; 14,15(SPA); 21,22
i complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .	1,2
fabulous italian food !	0,1
– i highly recommend mioposto .	2,3
i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood .	3,4; 9,10(SPA)
the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy .	4,5; 8,9
i love this restaurant	1,2
– i will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance i experience at this restaurant .	6,7; 17,18(SPA)
the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .	4,5; 14,15; 23,24; 28,29
i have not a bad thing to say about this place .	4,5
the food was great !	3,4
it ' s * very * reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .	6,7; 9,10
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect .	8,9
– in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .	12,13; 25,26; 30,31
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .	1,2; 7,8
caution - its real food for people who love the best .	10,11
i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .	1,2; 10,11
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .	2,3; 18,19
rice is too dry , tuna was n ' t so fresh either .	2,3
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .	2,3; 7,8; 18,19
however , the value and service are both severely lacking .	9,10
furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .	7,8; 13,14
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive .	6,7
on a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand - and - foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby .	9,10; 17,18(SPA); 23,24(SPA)
freshest sushi – i love this restaurant .	0,1
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .	5,6(SPA)
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted .	4,5; 6,7
their apps are all delicious .	4,5
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .	9,10
but the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .	6,7; 12,13
– the food was not great & the waiters were rude .	4,5; 10,11
great service	0,1
my service was stellar !	3,4
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .	3,4
food was fine , with a some little - tastier - than - normal salsa .	1,2; 9,10
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .	3,4; 12,13; 14,15
mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .	10,11; 16,17
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it ' s edible , even when you order ahead .	2,3; 14,16
but once done , it ' s not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .	7,8; 12,13; 17,18
best sushi in town .	0,1
the best calamari in seattle !	1,2
– . . . and the best summertime deck experience - - they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather .	6,7
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .	1,2; 13,14(SPA)
endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !	6,7
– by far the best bar in the east village . . .	4,5
great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .	0,1; 7,8(SPA)
definitely has one of the best jukebox ' s i ' ve seen in a long long time .	5,6; 15,16
the food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .	3,4
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .	3,4; 7,8(SPA)
and the upstairs is a great place to hang out .	5,6
not alot of smoking places left in new york , but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .	15,16
the sushi here is delicious !	4,5
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .	1,2
i ' ve had the jellyfish , horse mackerel , blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others , and they were all good .	25,26
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .	2,3; 10,11
the decor is rustic , traditional japanese .	5,6
the crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .	4,5(SPA); 6,7
the service was courteous and attentive .	3,4; 5,6
mediocre food	0,1
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .	2,3(SPA)
my g / f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .	12,13; 16,17
we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one - time customer tourists .	9,10; 16,17
service was decent .	1,2
drinks were good .	2,3
excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive	0,1
– i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .	2,3; 29,30
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney .	4,5; 6,7
best indian food in l . a .	0,1
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .	9,10
the chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .	9,10
it ' s located in a strip mall near the beverly center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .	15,16; 21,22; 23,24
never too crowded and always great service .	0,1; 5,6
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .	17,18
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .	3,4
i appreciate their delivery too .	1,2
nice food but no spice !	0,1
– i really enjoyed my meal here .	3,4
i had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .	2,3
the food was all good but it was way too mild .	4,5; 9,10
the naan was some of the best i ' ve had and i really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .	6,7; 14,15
even the chickpeas , which i normally find too dry , were good .	12,13
– i do n ' t understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long . . . the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - everything is delicious .	22,23(SPA); 33,34
i love the warm & cosy environment .	1,2
i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - ca n ' t wait to celebrate my next birthday there .	25,26; 27,28
best restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager	0,1; 13,14

everything i ' ve had here is good , taco salads , burritos , enchiladas i love this place .	7,8; 16,17
also have great margaritas !	2,3
the food is simply unforgettable !	4,5
the presentation of the food was an added bonus , it looked just as great as it tasted !	14,15
my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere !	1,2; 15,16
the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful .	3,4
go to open sesame ! ! !	0,1
holy hummus !	0,1
– the food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .	6,7; 12,13
dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .	4,5
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .	2,3(SPA)
the side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .	6,7
also , they serve the best hummus in america , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , i believe is the traditional way ) !	5,6
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .	2,3; 9,10
however , this place is a gem , and i wo n ' t stop going back .	6,7; 11,14
great beer	0,1
– my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !	17,18
i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .	2,3; 10,11
the band was very good and the service was attentive .	4,5; 9,10
we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .	29,30
seattle ' s best winelist	3,4
– ray ' s ( suprisingly ) has the city ' s best & most diverse wine list .	5,6; 12,13; 14,15
the sommelier is fantastic , down - to - earth , & extremely knowlegable .	3,4; 13,14
i would go back for the wine experience alone .	2,3
not the place it once was	0,1
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the ` ` dive ' ' category .	6,7
– it is sad to see a place that was once ` ` the ' ' place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the place that is a big ` ` dont bother . ' '	3,4; 37,38
the food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere ( including mainland europe ) .	25,26
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .	8,9
this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions ` ` diners , drive - ins , and dives ' ' hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .	6,7
open & cool place with the best pizza and coffee	2,3; 6,7

what else can you say nice people amazing food wow	5,6
great food with an awesome atmosphere !	0,1
– eggs , pancakes , potatoes , fresh fruit and yogurt - - everything they serve is delicious .	13,14(SPA); 17,18
the best place for a leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts , then take a stroll through the nearby farmer ' s market .	1,2
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent - - there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi - - this fish was perfect ! ! ! !	0,1; 30,31
plus , i am allergic to rice , and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating - - did n ' t even bat an eye !	4,5
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake ! !	5,6

melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi , and very tasty rolls too .	0,1; 10,11

save room for scrumptious desserts .	3,4
the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n ' t forget !	6,7(SPA)
– best mexican place for lunch in the financial district .	1,2
love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials .	0,1; 12,13
the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes .	8,9(SPA)
can get busy on fridays for a table but once seated , the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .	2,3; 15,16; 25,26
the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .	3,4; 9,10
the atmosphere was just okay .	4,5
space was limited , but the food made up for it .	7,8
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .	5,6; 8,9; 12,13
finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , ` ` are you waiting for a table ? ' '	9,10
the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n ' t eat it .	11,14
great food , better margaritas !	0,1
– this is one of my top lunch spots , huge portions , fast service and amazing margaritas ! !	16,17

plenty of food , trust me .	0,1
fresh ingrediants and super tasty .	0,1; 4,5
best food , phenominal service	0,1
for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer , the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .	11,12; 21,22; 26,27
not only can the selection be innovative , but there ' s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .	6,7; 13,14
the nicest waiters in town .	1,2
– this place is unbelievably over - rated .	7,8
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then i would put murphy ' s at the top of the list .	8,9(SPA); 15,16(SPA); 27,28
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .	13,14
your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer soho location , and of course : salmon , tuna , fluke , yellow tail , cod , mackeral , jellyfish , sea urchin , shrimp , lobster , sea bream , trout , milk fish , blue fin tuna , eel , crab , sardine , monk fish , roe , scallop , oysters , and a varity of toro .	6,7; 11,12; 15,16
there is only one place on the east coast that has it all , plus a lot more .	12,13; 17,18
bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : blue ribbon sushi .	14,15
hands down , the best tuna i have ever had .	0,1; 4,5
blue ribbon lives up to it ' s fantastic reputation .	8,9
great value sushi with high quality & nice setting .	0,1; 7,8
try the chef ' s choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .	0,1; 13,14; 19,20
poor customer service / poor pizza .	0,1; 4,5
– as with most restaurants in seattle , mioposto ' s service was bad and the food was overpriced .	13,14; 18,19
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but mioposto ' s pizza lacks quality and good taste .	6,7; 19,20
to be honest , i ' ve had better frozen pizza .	10,11(SPA)
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location .	2,3
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we ' ve eaten here more than 10 times .	14,15; 18,19; 30,31
the food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ' ve been there .	3,4; 11,12
the only problem would be the wait , but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting .	2,3
seabass on lobster risotto was the best .	6,7
caesar salad was superb .	3,4
great bottle of wine .	0,1
leave room for dessert .	3,4(SPA)
i waited for 10 - 15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .	1,2; 14,15
the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .	10,11; 15,16
avoid the place	0,1
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !	17,18
we left without ever getting service .	1,2
best crab cakes in town	0,1
– thats a big statement considering i ' ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time .	31,32
if you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .	14,15
great seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .	0,1; 8,9
great pizza , poor service	3,4
– love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .	1,2; 5,6
also love their caeser salad .	1,2
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n ' t like the servers , one young woman in particular .	15,16; 23,24
– this place is famous for their breakfast .	4,5
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n ' t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .	8,9
it ' s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n ' t so impersonal and corporate - like .	4,5
great breakfast	0,1
the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .	3,4; 6,7
i love breakfast here .	1,2
their crab eggs benedict is addicting .	4,5
all their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .	2,3(SPA); 10,11
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time	0,1; 9,10
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .	6,7; 8,9
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .	4,5; 6,7
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter . . . soooo good . . . the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .	20,21; 35,36
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .	0,1
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .	3,4; 6,7
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one . . . the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .	24,25; 37,38; 40,41
chintzy portions	0,1
– the sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for nyc ) .	5,6; 29,30
terrible service , food ok , pricey	0,1
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n ' t a fancy place .	8,9; 17,20
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park .	2,3; 13,14(SPA); 17,18(SPA)
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .	5,6
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao - - um um um ) .	0,1; 6,7
as usual the omikase did n ' t disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .	5,8; 15,16
their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n ' t remember what we had .	4,5; 9,12
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it .	7,8
great selection of sakes .	0,1
it is n ' t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .	11,12
very poor customer service .	1,2
– schooner or later ' s charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .	20,21; 26,27
while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .	5,6; 13,14; 25,26
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .	10,11
great service .	0,1
good sake selection .	0,1
dungeness crabs here !	1,2
– ray ' s is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners .	4,5; 11,12
i love dungeness crabs and at ray ' s you can get them served in about 6 different ways !	1,2; 17,18
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .	3,4(SPA); 8,9
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting . . . . yummy !	18,19
and the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .	9,10
– great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , b fast burritos , gluten free menu .	1,2; 15,16
the service is fantastic at this fun place .	3,4
if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open , you know it is great .	23,24
best neighborhood standby .	0,1
in grammercy / union square / east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .	14,15
the music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .	3,4; 18,19; 27,28
oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !	4,5(SPA)
good food , great service , average prices ( for the strip )	0,1; 3,4
when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .	11,12
the music playing was very hip , 20 - 30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .	29,30
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .	6,7(SPA)
it was n ' t the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok .	2,5; 15,16
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .	1,2; 10,11; 12,13
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .	9,10
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .	7,8; 14,15; 16,17
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .	12,13(SPA); 19,20
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .	3,4; 13,14
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .	9,10
overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again .	4,5
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .	4,5; 8,9
good sake , good food – i honestly do n ' t know much about japanese food at all .	0,1; 3,4
server made several sake suggestions which were very good .	8,9
had many dishes but the best was the lobster 3 ways .	5,6
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .	4,5; 12,13
also , there was only one bathroom stall - probably need more for such big crowds .	6,7(SPA)
most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .	1,2; 6,7
at best , the food was good and definately overpriced .	9,10
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .	12,13
my favortie pizza joint in seattle	2,3(SPA)
– this is my ` ` must bring out of town guests to ' ' restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it .	19,20
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .	3,4; 8,9
i ' ve always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly .	3,4; 20,21
i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .	3,4; 11,12
– my husband and i love eating at mioposto cafe .	5,6
we ' re ca n ' t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza ’ s !	-1,-1
you won ’ t be disappointed by their menu .	-1,-1
the pizza ' s are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings .	11,12
try the pizza ensalata !	0,1
the pizza ' s are not huge and the crust is thin … keep that in mind when you ’ re ordering .	-1,-1
the food is sinful .	3,4
the staff was really friendly .	4,5
the atmosphere was great .	1,2(SPA)
the specialty here is decadent pancakes , but i ' ve been back now four times , and i ' ve been wowed every time .	22,23
nothing on the menu is less than amazing .	7,8
good eats .	0,1
i have been to this place , folks and it is bad .	11,12
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that ' s half - way decent .	3,4; 26,27
i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .	8,9(SPA); 19,20(SPA)
– the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .	4,5; 13,14
the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns - just outstanding .	1,2; 10,11
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable .	12,13
the service is really attentive and charming .	4,5; 6,7
the service was excellent , the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .	3,4; 8,9; 17,18
– i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .	10,11; 19,20
the food is fantastic , authentic , delicious and very , very affordable .	3,4
the decor was beautiful and unique .	3,4; 5,6
there was a really nice vibe about the place . . . good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .	4,5; 12,13
our server was very professional and friendly .	3,4; 6,7
to the owners of open sesame . . . bravo . . . i ca n ' t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !	9,10
it ' s a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( thurs ? sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .	5,6; 35,36(SPA)
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .	10,11
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .	3,4; 6,7
the sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you ' d think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !	1,2(SPA); 7,8
if you ' re interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place . . .	2,4; 20,21
big thick pepperoni	0,1
– the pepperoni ' s cut real thick - - yum .	2,3(SPA)
the pizza itself is not exactly the best i ' ve had ever , but still pretty good .	17,18
food was good and appetizing .	2,3
portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .	3,4; 13,14
fair menu selection .	1,2(SPA)
the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious .	3,4; 10,11; 13,14
indoor ambience was modern .	1,2(SPA)
if it ' s nice outside , request for a table in the balcony .	4,5
it ' s a great place to people watch .	4,5
late night dinning with exeptional food .	1,2
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .	11,12
the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .	3,4; 18,19
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i ' ve ever try .	4,5; 11,12
the portions are big though , so do not order too much .	8,9
groovy music made the dinner casual .	0,1
i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .	9,10(SPA)
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .	1,2(SPA); 10,11; 16,17
– mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !	5,6
the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !	6,7
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .	12,13; 20,21(SPA)
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .	5,6; 32,33
to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .	13,14
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .	14,15
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .	17,18
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8 . 50 for 3 - 6 ' ' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 ' ' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .	43,44
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 ' ' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .	15,16
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n ' t rejected the meal all together .	4,5; 15,16; 36,37
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .	1,2; 24,25
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .	4,5
much more than just a great view !	0,1; 5,6
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray ' s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .	4,5; 18,19
ray ' s is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .	13,14
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray ' s !	2,3; 14,15
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .	6,7
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler . . . a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray ' s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .	1,2(SPA); 11,12; 20,21; 35,36; 58,59
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .	10,11
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .	12,13; 14,15; 19,20
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .	9,10
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .	15,16
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray ' s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?	2,3; 5,6; 14,15
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .	16,17; 25,26
oh yeah . . . the view was good , too .	8,9
yum !	-1,-1
do n ' t leave the restaurant without it .	1,4
no comparison	1,2
– i ca n ' t say enough about this place .	7,8
snotty attitude	0,1
– we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .	5,6
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes .	1,2
they are not greasy or anything .	3,4
overrated	0,1
– i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda .	4,5
i will not go back .	2,3

very disappointing	1,2
– i took my parents here for their anniversary - very very disappointed ! ! !	12,13
nothing really came across as outstanding .	2,3
very disappointed .	1,2
we were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20 + per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .	7,8; 16,17
you are bound to have a very charming time .	1,2; 6,7
not recommanded ! ! !	0,1
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there ! ! !	2,3; 10,11(SPA)
– pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown .	1,2; 2,3
if you ' re in the area you should n ' t be disappointed .	9,12
ok . . . . – maybe i went in on someone ' s bad day . . . .	14,15
took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .	0,1; 11,12; 26,27
i do n ' t know if i ' ll be back . . . .	5,6
everything you want and more , very fresh .	6,7
its worth the wait , especially since they ' ll give you a call when the table is ready .	1,2; 5,6
i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !	1,2; 20,21
every time ` ` 0 - sixtynine ' ' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !	14,15(SPA)
been there lots since and its always a good time .	0,1; 8,9
i found a new home on second avenue ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1,2
just go there and see for yourself .	1,2
you need to watch your game , they will have it on for you .	5,6
kudos to these guys .	0,1
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease .	1,2; 7,8
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n ' t recommend going here .	12,15
you are likely to be disappointed .	5,6
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .	6,7; 12,13; 21,22; 26,27
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge ! ( it was a bit expensive )	1,2
the best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .	1,2; 8,9
hidden little jem	0,1
– tucked away over by the beverly center .	6,7
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there , which is always a good sign .	14,15
normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n ' t .	3,4; 13,16
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .	3,4
and they packaged everything nicely so it did n ' t spill .	4,5
awesome find	0,1
you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too !	9,10
lebanese food ! yum !	0,1
– i ' ve been to open sesame only once , but i ' m still reeling from the experience ! !	16,17
what a tastly , flaky treat !	4,5
there have been several occasions when we ' ve just not gotten some side dishes we ' ve ordered .	10,11
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1 / 2 hours for our food .	1,2; 14,15(SPA)
however , one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised .	20,21
it was like dining at a completely different restaurant .	3,4(SPA)
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .	8,9; 24,25
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .	20,21
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .	12,13
nice job !	0,1
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .	2,3
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .	1,2; 7,8
untill this happens , my advice is to stay away .	9,10
old reliable	1,2
– after 12 years in seattle ray ' s rates as the place we always go back to .	14,15
i liked it .	1,2
it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did , since it was delicious .	17,18
wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1,-1
– it cant get any better ! ! ! ! !	3,4
absolutely fabulous ! ! !	1,2
two thumbs up !	1,2
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .	1,2; 13,14
splendid	0,1
perfect on a cold day .	0,1
$ 6 with tip .	3,4
perfection .	0,1
on weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .	7,8
however , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .	16,17
that ' s a huge compliment , especially in the fickled restaurant business , . . . enough already !	4,5
i guarantee you wo n ' t be disappointed , there ' s also valet parking .	4,7
a cozy spot for 2	1,2
– i ca n ' t believe murphy ' s has been around for over 25 years , amazing .	18,19
addicting !	0,1
i went there with a friend from out of town . . . and we were both very impressed !	1,2
the price was right too .	3,4
i ' d go back there in a heartbeat .	8,9
well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .	6,7; 13,14
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .	3,4
the prior reviews said kid friendly . . . give me a break with two young children that is light years .	3,4; 12,13
it was decent but nothing exceptional .	4,5
the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking .	5,6
way over - rated ! ! ! !	3,4
10 !	-1,-1
cut to the chase - this is amazing !	7,8
it ' s unpretentious and underground .	1,3
it ' s fresh , welcoming , delicious , and relaxing .	7,8; 10,11
i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .	8,9; 12,13
what a find !	2,3
well worth it	1,2
good for late night dining ( last minute planning ) without reservations .	0,1
love it every time	0,1
never had one single problem there .	4,5
seafood plus	0,1(SPA)
– this was great dining experience .	3,4
if you ' re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n ' t miss this one .	20,21
completely over rated !	2,3
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .	7,8; 10,11
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .	4,5; 19,20; 21,22
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .	2,3; 6,7; 24,25
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .	7,8; 14,15
it was clear he didn ’ t really care .	-1,-1
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit .	4,5; 9,10
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .	5,6
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .	33,34
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .	9,10(SPA)
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .	14,15; 19,20
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n ' t work .	12,13; 17,20
always a winner .	0,1
she does n ' t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .	2,5; 14,15
but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .	13,14
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .	8,9(SPA); 13,14
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .	3,4; 10,11
does n ' t get any better than that .	6,7
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .	10,11
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .	3,4; 7,8
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that . . . i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .	19,20
yummy .	0,1
not chewy at all .	1,2
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !	15,16
melt in your mouth .	0,1
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .	4,5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel . . . but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .	30,31; 34,35; 36,37
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .	16,17
i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .	8,9
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it ' d be a 30 minute wait .	4,5; 13,14; 22,23
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !	1,2; 23,24
none that i can think of .	0,1
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n ' t arrive until 45 minutes later . . . with our main course .	4,5; 14,15
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?	2,3
oh i forgot to mention that they do n ' t have bread service .	8,11
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n ' t a priority for them to actually bring it .	13,14; 22,23; 28,31; 36,37
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .	2,3(SPA); 19,22
its great if you spent the day there and did n ' t want to drive to eat .	1,2
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .	3,4
always good .	1,2
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .	11,12; 14,15
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;	1,2(SPA); 13,14
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .	15,16
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .	7,8(SPA); 12,13(SPA); 28,29
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .	15,16
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .	2,3; 8,9; 36,37
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n ' t bothered to get the waitresses name .	1,2; 3,4; 13,14; 22,23; 31,32
in short , schooner or later could n ' t have cared less about our being at their establishment .	11,12; 12,13
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .	21,22
and they give good quantity for the price .	3,4
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !	13,14
this is the case at this gem .	6,7
you ca n ' t go wrong here .	5,6
seriously , you ca n ' t go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .	7,8; 15,16
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant .	4,5; 15,16
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .	15,16; 22,23
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .	2,3; 11,12
just remember to dress a little urban - chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .	13,14(SPA)
very good !	1,2
overpriced	0,1
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .	10,11
not sure if i would go back .	0,1
in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .	4,5; 6,7
they are n ' t the most talkative , but everytime i ' ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .	2,5; 27,28
it ' s just the right size for the menu .	5,6
excellent	0,1
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .	1,2
the pizza ' s are light and scrumptious .	7,8
worth the wait	0,1
– had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning , but it was so worth it .	20,21
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .	18,19
i do n ' t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .	6,7
donot go !	0,1
delicious	0,1
we waited for an hour to be seated .	1,2
it was worth the wait .	2,3
plan on waiting 30 - 70 minutes .	6,7
will definitely be back .	1,2
delicious . . . !	0,1
delectable	0,1
once you ' re inside , the real experience begins .	8,9
i probably would n ' t go back though ' cuz i do n ' t know if it ' s worth it .	6,7; 16,17; 19,21
maybe i ' ll go back once more many years from now when i ' ve forgotten i went there already .	5,6; 19,20
sit in the balcony	3,4(SPA)
– not bad .	1,2
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .	10,11
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .	2,3
should check - up on us more frequently , do n ' t you think ?	10,13
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .	2,3; 15,16
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .	10,11(SPA)
this place rocks ! !	1,2
the chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .	6,7; 12,13
the atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing . .	1,2(SPA); 11,12
insultingly overpriced	1,2
- mediocre service / quality	1,2; 4,5
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .	14,15; 20,21
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner . . . they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .	1,2
all considered , i have to say that ray ' s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .	13,14
