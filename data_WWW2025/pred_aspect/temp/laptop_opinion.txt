the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .	2,3; 12,13
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .	8,9; 13,14
also it ' s not a true ssd drive in there but emmc , which makes a difference .	2,4
the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer .	3,4
2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .	7,8
it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows .	6,9
hopefully in 10 years they ' ll have this figured out and it won ' t suck so badly .	13,16
bought this last year on july .	3,4(SPA)
i rarely use the keyboard .	2,3
- great price for a touchscreen chromebook	1,2
it is glitchy , and barely usable .	2,3; 5,6
i ordered one , the touch pad failed to work consistently .	7,8; 10,11
i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !	8,9; 19,20; 25,26; 29,30
i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future .	3,4; 14,15; 19,20; 27,28
i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing .	7,8; 26,27
i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours .	3,4; 12,13
hdmi out doesn ' t work right .	2,5
they had it over a week and then shipped back .	1,2
i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .	1,2; 8,9; 23,26
clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved .	0,1; 15,16
i bought this for my daughter to use to take online classes while she ' s overseas in europe for a year .	1,2
decent sound quality .	0,1
flimsy power adapter .	0,1
wi - fi slows down to crowl and speeds back up intermittently .	3,4; 11,12
regret buying it at times .	0,1
it just turned off and will not turn back on .	3,4
the product is great , but the customer support is horrible .	3,4; 10,11
called support a second time after 10 minutes of verifying some type of info they told me to call google without even trying to help .	0,1; 15,16; 21,22
but i ' m getting into photography now , and it ' s terrible for loading , storing , and editing pictures .	13,14
i have sent it in twice already and waiting for it to come back .	5,6
the screen looked great .	3,4
no matter how many times i reinserted the charging adapter , i kept getting this message .	6,7; 12,13
i had no option but to shut down the computer , unplug it , plug it back in , and then reboot .	11,12; 14,15
it has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on .	2,3
the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so .	2,3
i noticed the battery went down to 67 % for no reason .	5,6
works good but the fan kicks in pretty often , which is to keep the laptop cool but the sound is annoying .	1,2; 21,22
nano edge display is nice .	4,5
everything was fine and i went out for an hour .	2,3
the audio is almost impossible to hear .	4,5
it is slow to do everything .	2,3
here ' s the kicker : it is doing a terrible job running dragon age .	4,5(SPA); 10,11
it doesn ' t has backlit keyboard : ( typing in low light is such a pain .	1,4
very disappointed in how slow it seems .	1,2; 4,5
keyboard and mouse pad seem fine , but overall it seems strangely slow .	5,6; 11,12
i have been using this for just 3 months .	2,3
crazy keypad : this issue is even worse .	0,1
overall , the laptop has a solid feel to it .	6,7
this lead me to believe that although i purchased a “ new ” product , they sent me a refurbished one instead .	-1,-1
i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop .	16,17
i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you .	1,2; 21,22; 24,25; 43,46
lightweight .	0,1
yesterday the backlight went out .	3,4
it was brand new out of the box , i ' ve never dropped it .	12,13
now i have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc .	0,1
ram upgrade available	2,3
hard drive upgrade available	1,2
i had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start .	6,7; 8,9
it ' s still a mainly functional computer , but using it is just not the greatest .	5,6; 14,15
we ' ve had the computer for 5 weeks , used it a total of less than 20 hours , and now it will be gone for 3 weeks .	15,16; 21,22
i send it to asus warranty and now after a week they ' re sending it back stating the no problem was found .	17,18; 20,21
display stop working within 2 months .	1,2
since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .	9,10; 26,27
after reading all the bad reviews , just sent it back for a refund .	4,5; 13,14(SPA)
all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad .	10,11
my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it .	2,3; 5,6
don ' t even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good .	0,3
keyboard needs to be redesigned entirely .	1,2; 4,5
6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings .	10,11; 17,18
so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `	13,14
after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .	1,2
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .	2,3; 13,14
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .	1,2
it seems put together well .	3,4
what they lack in size , they make up for in raw speed , durability , and energy efficiency .	7,8; 18,19
+ decent quantity of available ports	1,2
+ it has a dvd drive : o	2,3
- it runs hot !	3,4
running grid benchmark , it got to a high 92 / 93 degrees c !	13,14(SPA)
- new i5 mobile processor .	2,3(SPA)
- ddr4 ram that is upgradable .	5,6
- very decent battery life .	2,3
so far i am pleasantly impressed with this unit , however i have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date .	4,5
i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) .	7,8
i ' ve been using it for at least 4 hours since last charged in that 23 % used up .	17,18(SPA)
- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .	9,10; 17,18; 23,24; 35,36
- easily upgradeable ram	2,3
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .	4,5
it ' s not fancy , but it ' s good value and fast and trouble - free .	10,11; 13,14; 17,18
after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .	11,12
easily upgrade to storage and ram .	0,1
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .	4,5; 9,10(SPA)
i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .	1,2; 24,25
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .	14,15
it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .	4,5; 9,10
i am very impressed with this system .	3,4
mastercam itself runs pretty good .	4,5
as usual amazon was great about returning it .	4,5
screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished .	2,3
i like the back lit keyboard .	1,2
it ' s a lot of good for a comparatively cheap price .	6,7
the screen is perfectly adequate .	3,4
this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful .	4,5; 10,11
google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate .	5,6; 10,11
i would highly recommend this to anyone , but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable , easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet .	16,17; 18,19
i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome .	3,4
this thing is still fantastic for what it is .	4,5
i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 .	19,20
i couldn ' t be happier with this product !	1,4
the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it .	5,6
the size is perfect , it ' s easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room .	3,4; 8,9; 25,26
works great right out of the box , as advertised .	1,2
the battery life on this seems good .	6,7
this chromebook instantly connects to the internet .	2,3
going to a grocery store or fitness center , the android tablets took so long to connect that i finished my shopping before they came online .	14,15
everything is perfect .	2,3
powers up immediately , great battery life , great keyboard , amazing features .	0,1; 4,5; 8,9; 11,12
was considering an apple product but i ' m much happier with this !	10,11
this is my third samsung chromebook and i will continue to use this brand .	13,14
does not act like a tablet , but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance , including video streaming .	1,2; 17,18
this was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use .	2,3; 10,11
great price for a good book used for college students who carry all day	4,5
i bought this refurbished and haven ' t experienced any issues .	5,8
this laptop is very straight forward .	4,5
otherwise , it ' s great .	5,6
also , secure os .	0,1
the product itself is awesome .	4,5
great little laptop and tablet !	0,1
the chormebook works as described by seller .	1,2(SPA)
i like the size and features .	1,2
however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with .	4,5; 14,15; 16,17; 20,21
love the keyboard .	0,1
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !	2,3; 10,11; 13,14
i am so glad i purchased this and would definitely purchase again .	3,4; 9,10
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .	12,13
great for going on the internet .	0,1
it works well for her .	1,2
we ran world of tank blitz ( using a game controller ) and roblocks on the low rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play .	21,22
another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud .	5,6(SPA); 6,9
love it	0,1
great battery life .	0,1
easy to take with and do homework on the go too !	0,1
i would recommend it to anyone .	2,3
this is perfect .	2,3
battery life , speed , display and software were my additional top reasons why i went for the samsung .	3,4(SPA); 18,19(SPA)
the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever .	3,4; 15,16; 17,18; 20,21
nice , i ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use .	0,1; 7,8
i love my chromebook .	1,2
it is taking me a while to get used to the small , tight keyboard .	2,3; 11,12
after researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank , i finally chose this one .	5,6; 10,11; 15,16
delivery was a bit off but i blame usps on that , they suck in my area .	7,8; 13,14
amd a12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an ssd .	5,6
light for its size , not much flex in the body .	0,1; 3,4
stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !	0,1
this computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars .	4,5
great functioning computer .	0,1
excellent laptop at a reasonable price .	0,1; 4,5
this laptop does all i need it to do .	2,3
works flawlessly and decent battery life .	0,1; 3,4
excelente laptop	0,1
great for graphics , nothing to complex but it can get the job done	0,1
about what i was expecting / hoping it to be .	6,7; 9,10
it has been able to handle everything i ' ve needed for my business .	3,4; 6,7(SPA)
it is fast enough for what we do , and it has all the features we needed for less .	2,3
love our new laptop .	0,1
battery could last longer .	2,3
light weight , good battery life , sharp screen .	0,1; 3,4
he is very content with it and its features	2,3
great performance , quiet and cool processor .	0,1; 3,4; 5,6
the sims 4 ran very smoothly on regular graphics .	5,6
i was really excited to get this laptop !	3,4
runs first person shooters relatively well .	4,5
would definitely buy this again if i needed to do so .	2,3
laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy .	10,11
the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .	5,8
it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .	5,6; 11,12; 19,20
nice and thin , light , surprised it has a dvd player in it .	0,1; 6,7
for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !	12,13; 18,19; 21,22
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .	2,3
fast processor .	0,1
if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !	20,21
i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu .	6,7
this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart .	3,4
the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !	6,7
has all the available ports that i need .	0,1
laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board .	3,4
great computer , you can play 2015 and below games on this computer .	0,1
great laptop !	0,1
she can stream music or videos , do her homework , and so on , so we are all pleased with our purchase .	19,20
cpu performance does well .	3,4
i bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills .	1,2
really like it .	0,1
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .	8,9; 14,15(SPA)
webpages load quickly .	2,3
but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all .	5,7
for us , it was perfect .	5,6
i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good .	21,22
i love how sleek and thin it is .	1,2
great feel to the keyboard as well .	0,1
this is a super fast computer and i really like it .	4,5; 9,10
it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school .	6,7
i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off .	15,16
i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life .	13,14
battery life is short , but plugging it in works .	3,4; 9,10
sleek design .	0,1
easy to use .	0,1
nice computer for responsible grade school child .	0,1
this laptop is well engineered and designed .	3,4; 6,7
this is a very nice laptop .	4,5
it is perfect for everything i need it for .	2,3
provided just what i wanted at a resonable price .	7,8
this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems .	3,4
great price and great performance but terrible battery .	6,7
it is a little slow .	4,5
great computer , setup was fast and easy .	0,1; 5,6; 7,8
i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 .	2,3; 11,12
graphics are good for the level of this laptop .	2,3
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .	0,1; 4,5
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .	3,4; 12,13
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .	0,1
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .	4,5; 14,15
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .	1,2
after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .	12,13
it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings .	15,16; 17,18
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .	15,16; 23,24
i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .	32,33(SPA); 46,47
the touch screen works wonderfully .	4,5
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .	3,4; 9,10
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .	1,2; 10,11
hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .	0,1; 19,20; 21,22
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?	0,1; 26,27
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .	0,1; 20,21
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .	4,5; 8,9
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .	1,4; 17,18; 25,26
look , dont buy it .	2,3
the screen does look good .	4,5
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .	0,1; 3,4
battery life its ok .	3,4
then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .	20,21; 24,25
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .	2,3; 9,10
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .	1,4; 28,29
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .	3,4; 5,6
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .	1,2; 6,7
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .	2,3; 9,10
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .	3,4
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !	6,7; 13,14
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .	9,12
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .	2,3; 7,8
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .	23,24
at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .	7,8
which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `	9,10
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .	1,4; 4,5
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .	3,4; 19,20
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .	3,4; 24,25
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .	6,7; 21,22; 26,27
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .	25,26
i love it !	1,2
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .	16,19; 56,57
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .	4,5
overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .	3,4
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .	27,28
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .	1,2
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .	0,1; 6,7
chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .	35,36; 39,40
the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !	21,22
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .	7,8
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .	8,9
this is a solid , well - balanced design .	3,4; 7,8
first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever .	10,11
i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks .	5,6
as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .	7,8
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .	2,3; 20,21
secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .	7,8
there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .	8,9
secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .	0,1; 7,8
the battery is good .	3,4
if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .	24,25
i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office .	3,4(SPA)
battery seems to be pretty good .	5,6
with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy .	2,3; 8,9
this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc .	4,5(SPA)
it does everything that i need and is surprisingly fast .	2,3(SPA); 9,10
i want to cry because this doesn ' t support google play store !	6,9; 10,11
i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all .	15,16; 36,37
this is a huge plus !	3,4
- drives are now solid state drive .	4,5
- new built - in speakers .	2,3
- no dvd drive .	3,4
i couldn ' t drag - and - drop items in it , but after i changed the behavior in settings , everything went well from there .	1,4; 24,25
it is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop .	2,3
very sharp screen and good viewing angles .	1,2; 4,5
something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .	12,13
no complaints here .	1,2
this computer is blazing fast .	3,4
with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant .	8,9; 11,12
the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time .	3,4; 8,9
this thing is fast and efficient .	3,4; 5,6
this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it .	4,5
the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter .	8,9
the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp .	5,6
the best laptop i ' ve owned .	1,2
bought it for my grandson for college and he loves it .	9,10
overall , this is an excellent machine .	5,6
good durability , outstanding performance and portability .	0,1; 3,4
response is excellent .	2,3
- battery life appears to be excellent	6,7
- laptop is light .	3,4
- generous selection of ports ( this is in reference to the newer model )	1,2
- laptop is sleek and dare i say , sexy	2,3; 9,10
i enjoy the processing speed of this model .	1,2
fast shipping , product exactly as described , authentic apple , new , factory sealed in box .	0,1; 8,9
loving the sharp display and the track pad .	0,1
i am in love with how light and speedy it is .	3,4; 8,9
i love this macbook .	1,2
great product	0,1
this is an amazing computer i bought from cellelectronics .	3,4
they put a lot of thought and work into making sure that the hardware and software work real well together .	18,19
obviously great computer	1,2
very nice laptop , i love its portable feature and the running speed is very fast .	1,2; 5,6; 15,16
the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life .	2,3
it is thinner , and lighter .	2,3
awesome computer .	0,1
the shipping was fast and the seller was great	3,4; 8,9
the mac is great besides a chip under the mouse pad .	3,4
the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing .	3,4; 11,12
yeah the new mac book is lighter and only a little small but the internals are a lot slower .	18,19
love this computer !	0,1
force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome .	6,7
works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous .	10,11
the laptop arrived in excellent condition .	4,5
i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac .	2,3
battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description .	4,7
this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it .	5,6
if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence .	11,12
the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives .	8,9(SPA)
it ' s far away from meeting my expectations .	3,4; 8,9
i really like how it isn ' t bulky .	2,3; 5,8
great price and customer service	0,1
however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises .	14,15
laptop works perfect however i did get a used charger that only lasted a week .	2,3; 11,12
awesome machine .	0,1
costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market .	0,1; 13,14
this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life .	3,4; 29,30
great price .	0,1
great computer !	0,1
i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer .	12,13
great prodcut	0,1
i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector .	2,3
shipping was fast and product came as described .	2,3
apple updates are easy .	3,4
it arrived in great condition , and it ' s been working perfectly for me since i got it .	3,4; 12,13
high quaility computer in every way .	5,6
i like this machine quite a bit .	6,7
i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .	5,6; 11,12; 19,20; 23,24; 31,32
took a week or so to get used to , but love it now .	11,12
screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen .	0,1
battery : solid .	2,3
- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : (	5,6; 17,18
i mean , if you want a true tablet , buy a true tablet - - this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as i was planning to .	17,18; 22,23
i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) .	1,2
update it as soon as you turn it on !	0,1(SPA)
my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new .	1,2
however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage .	8,9
the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .	3,4; 12,13
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .	0,1(SPA); 10,11
so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .	2,3; 4,5; 16,17
maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection .	8,9
and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want .	14,15; 18,19
it does make quite a loud click when you depress the button .	5,6; 9,10
overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .	3,4; 7,8; 28,29
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !	6,7
i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .	1,2; 8,9
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .	3,4
i downloaded pandora and listened to all my stations at 3 / 4 volume and it sounded fine .	17,18
so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .	14,15; 25,26(SPA)
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .	2,3
i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer	1,2; 5,6; 16,17
i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .	9,10; 16,17
but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing .	4,5; 17,18
ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working .	23,26
the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t .	19,22
update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together .	9,10
while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up .	7,8
do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) .	2,3; 5,6; 31,32(SPA)
as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now .	4,5
the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty .	10,13
the macbook pro offers a very dependable machine that will muddle - through anything you throw at it without complaining .	5,6
2 usb ports and 2 thunderbolt ports on a $ 4500nz laptop ?	5,6
the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .	8,9
the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot .	3,4
first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !	3,4; 7,8
i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews .	1,2; 18,19
the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on .	4,5; 24,25
it ' s not stated anywhere that ' s it ' s used .	5,6
didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars .	0,3; 9,10
then one day , it stopped booting .	0,1; 5,6; 6,7
my daughter loves it and it will be a great tool to help her through nursing school .	2,3; 9,10
apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore .	0,1
* very good battery life	2,3
it is not worth it .	2,3
i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .	3,4; 17,18
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .	10,11
after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .	-1,-1
asus , has a horrible reputation .	4,5
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .	8,9
bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .	0,1; 9,10; 13,14
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .	4,5
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .	2,3
i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .	1,2; 7,8; 16,17
- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .	-1,-1
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .	6,7
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .	8,9
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .	15,16
second issue is with scaling of the ui .	1,2
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .	10,13
unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud .	14,15
• great battery life .	1,2
• volume is incredibly low .	4,5
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .	5,6; 19,20
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .	0,1; 13,14
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .	3,4; 7,8
transfer speeds ( lan to nas ) were miserably slow ( 10 - 30mbps ) .	9,10
it was perfect with no backlight bleed , no shimmery matte texture , no uneven backlight , no dead / stuck pixels .	2,3
this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on .	2,3; 20,21; 21,22
i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue .	10,11; 18,19
if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .	14,15; 27,28
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .	5,6; 12,13
the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .	3,4; 8,9; 10,11
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .	18,19
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .	6,7
things were fine until the unit stopped charging .	6,7
this is the problem with companies today .	3,4
asus customer service sucks .	3,4
i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year .	3,4; 24,25
it is a beautiful , well built laptop .	3,4; 5,6
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .	3,4
asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?	3,4(SPA)
i seriously love the product but i may have to return it .	2,3; 10,11
now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing .	2,3; 16,17
very impressed with my first chromebook .	0,1
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .	1,4; 19,20
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .	1,2
google docs work fine .	1,2(SPA)
a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming .	10,11
second , and most annoying , it would not identify my printer in cloud print .	0,1; 8,9
so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .	6,7
product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !	2,3; 6,7
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .	3,4; 11,12
not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .	0,1
and not buy any asus product again	1,2
the third one is ok but has a dead pixel .	4,5; 8,9
i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response .	9,10
this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal .	4,7; 15,16
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .	6,7; 11,12; 14,15
however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .	0,1; 10,11
battery life is not good .	3,4
but screen is very weird .	4,5
the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .	5,6; 23,24
a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months .	5,6
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .	3,4; 12,13
chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all .	2,3; 6,7
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .	4,5; 7,8
battery no longer charging .	0,1; 1,2
furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .	0,1; 7,8
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .	9,10
half the time it doesn ' t want to turn on and just flashes .	4,7; 13,14
the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks .	3,4; 19,20
in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged .	2,3(SPA); 33,34; 35,36
the screen hinge feels weak .	4,5
screen is average by 2017 standards .	5,6
the chromebook is brilliant overall .	3,4
google provides zeros customer support related to the os .	3,4(SPA)
horrible product .	0,1
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .	4,5
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .	5,6
it freezes constantly and needs to be shut off to start again .	2,3; 7,8
the microphone does not work with regular speaker .	3,4
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .	4,5
i tried returning the second one bu it does n ' t give me the option to return it .	9,12; 17,18
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .	7,8(SPA)
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .	7,8
however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .	0,1; 6,7
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .	10,11
mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .	8,9; 17,18; 21,22
however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port .	0,1; 2,3; 10,11
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service	5,6; 7,8
they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen .	7,8
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .	7,8; 16,17
the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .	3,4
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .	5,6
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .	2,3; 6,7
i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen .	4,5
however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .	7,8; 13,14
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .	6,7
i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop .	1,2
trackpad is ok .	2,3
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .	3,4
my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times .	2,3; 9,10
after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .	1,2; 24,25
run like heck from this machine .	2,3(SPA)
it will break , even if it works at first .	2,3
this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet .	5,6
literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .	0,1; 9,10; 18,19; 25,26; 31,32; 37,38
hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for .	13,14
by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .	5,6; 13,14
i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .	1,2; 12,13; 21,22; 31,32
the sound is really terrible and tinny .	6,7
it ' s fast .	3,4
excellent product	0,1
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .	4,5; 11,12
it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery .	11,12
so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .	10,11; 11,12
for the four days i used it , it worked pretty good .	11,12
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .	3,4; 9,10
we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping .	13,14
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .	3,4
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .	9,10
got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing .	5,6; 10,11
this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware .	7,8; 14,15
poor design and terrible tech support .	0,1; 3,4
this computer is amazing !	3,4
quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset .	19,20
not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop .	1,2; 6,7
this laptop was great starting out of the box .	3,4
their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful .	12,13
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .	0,1; 11,12; 22,23
after this issue i finally decided to return my product .	7,8
good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you .	9,10
i ' ve had to do a factory reset on this piece of garbage 4 times and i ' ve only owned it for 4 months .	15,16; 21,22
you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand .	4,5; 5,6
i really loved this laptop .	2,3
i will never own another msi product .	3,4
now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere .	3,4
so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work .	4,5; 13,16
eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product .	6,7; 21,22
when it is functioning it works great .	6,7
finding out you bought garbage for the steep price of $ 700 + .	4,5
overall a decent laptop if not for these problems , also , the laptop has minor screen freezes even while playing low graphical games like league of legends .	14,15
laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months .	1,2; 3,4
it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast .	4,5; 8,9; 11,12
the keyboard is very nice and very responsive .	4,5; 6,7
i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd .	1,2; 12,13
the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours .	2,5
had it for a month and it ' s riddled with problems .	0,1; 11,12
as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive .	10,11
+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness .	2,3
used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) .	7,8; 11,12
- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall )	2,3(SPA)
no backlit keyboard .	2,3(SPA)
it has plenty of power for most tasks .	2,3
the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m .	2,3; 16,17
i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal .	20,21; 25,26; 29,30
also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off .	5,6; 13,14(SPA); 20,21; 26,27(SPA); 33,34
haven ' t had any issues yet so pretty glad i chose this .	8,9
very nice looking laptop for the money .	1,2
features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m .	4,5
great quality computer .	0,1
like the flip , this has good build quality .	6,7
so far it has been able to handle everything i ' ve thrown at it .	8,9(SPA)
all in all , pretty good stuff .	5,6
2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 .	6,7
very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing .	1,2; 9,10
excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 .	0,1; 8,9
so , shortly after buying it i had to format it .	2,3; 7,8
and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging .	12,13
the fingerprint reader works most of the time .	2,3(SPA)
the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers .	3,4
not that this machine boots up slow .	0,1
great value for a laptop .	0,1
love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body .	0,1
cheaply made plastic but performance is well worth the trade for a $ 500 laptop .	0,1; 6,7
touchpad works well .	0,1(SPA)
the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position .	3,4; 10,11; 15,16
i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open .	12,13; 14,15
i like how it ' s so simple , without so much clutter and complexity .	1,2; 7,8
i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price .	15,16
anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester .	16,17
laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours .	2,3; 9,10
i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek .	3,4; 9,10; 12,13
it ' s decent .	3,4
ssd hardware issue	0,1
note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service	8,9; 29,30
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .	4,5; 19,20
daughter opened it for christmas and it doesn ' t stay on .	7,10
they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size .	2,3; 7,8
i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again .	6,7; 9,10
i will give them props for the build quality .	7,8(SPA)
combine these items together and this item became very frustrating .	9,10
- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel	1,2
- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 .	2,3
as you can see from the reviews it worked out fine for most people .	10,11
when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it .	16,17; 21,22
my acer aspire e 15 worked great for a day , and then shut off by itself .	6,7
by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot .	6,7; 11,12; 15,16
now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop .	9,10
good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down .	0,1
i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters .	7,8
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .	11,12; 22,23
can not remove the battery .	2,3
i too have the black screen problem .	6,7
computer is fine but the speakers broke after 1 week of use .	6,7
the computer is good for the price , but the hdmi port is already broken .	3,4; 14,15
won ' t turn on , won ' t charge , have to send it to tx to be repaired .	6,9; 11,12; 19,20
i want to insist that this is not a game laptop , as many have reviewed it as .	7,8
battery life can last me roughly 5 or 6 hours on internet usage alone with multiple tabs .	5,6
the speakers on the bottom take a moment to get used to but after that it ' s alright .	9,10; 16,18
also , i hate the keyboard - it feels really cheap .	3,4; 9,10
overall the laptop is cheap and flimsy .	3,4; 6,7
mx150 gaphics card is also pretty bad .	6,7
and i genuinely believed in acer , but first i had a lot of issues setting up the computer and after hours of customer service help the touch pad did n ' t even work .	8,9; 14,15; 29,30
i took it to my local computer repair who states it has a bad board .	13,14
there ' s something wrong with my laptop .	4,5
something is wrong with the power management .	2,3
very disappointed in the $ 600 e 15 , as opposed to the no frills , plain old , < $ 200 15 i ' ve had for 2 .	1,2
the trackpad stopped working after four weeks of using it .	2,3
there is a flicker in the middle of the screen that is very annoying .	3,4; 13,14
the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps .	3,4; 12,13(SPA)
otherwise , so far it is working well .	6,7
i presented my son with a gift of a defective machine .	9,10
the computer itself is actually quite fast with the ssd and processor , so my experience there so far has been good .	6,7; 21,22
keyboard and track pad shoved way left .	4,5
keyboard rattles loudly when typing on left side .	2,3
will not connect to wifi , amd screen flashes when adjusting while on .	1,2; 8,9
but the speakers are absolutely horrible !	5,6
latest 8th generation core i5 cpu	3,4
keyboard has flex	0,1(SPA)
no backlight at keyboard	3,4(SPA)
key presses are too stiff to press .	0,1
hdd makes this laptop very slow .	5,6
but asus engineers designed the case and laptop not to be opened by users .	8,9
there is no backlight and keys are too stiff .	7,8
i believe it is not healthy to use this keyboard for a long time .	4,5; 12,13
linux is mostly compatible with this laptop except fingerprint reader .	3,4
video converting process with same video file took only 25 minutes with asus vivobook f510ua .	8,9
3 ) you can hear the screen creak .	7,8
it doesn ' t support a hardwire connection .	1,4
i have installed no software on it yet it updates something every day and wants to reboot .	7,8
it just locked up again .	4,5
did i mention it sounds like a lawn mower ?	0,1; 4,5
i will say i do enjoy the screen quality , the wifi is fast on this laptop .	5,6; 13,14
in all , stay away .	4,5
- keyboard is comfortable to use	3,4
- finger doesn ' t side smoothly along track pad .	2,5
horrible laptop !	0,1
i had to spend over $ 160 to return it .	3,4; 8,9
i will never buy an other asus product .	5,6
it just crashed , dead .	2,3; 4,5
- the screen looks pretty good , except when viewing anything dark .	5,6
- the keyboard is awful .	4,5
when i asked asus for a replacement key , they said i ' d have to ship it back to them , which would have left me without a computer for 2 weeks .	0,1; 25,26
don ' t buy it .	0,3
after my 3rd boot up it ' s damaged .	8,9
after a month of use , disk ( c : ) runs at 100 % all the time .	14,15(SPA)
everything else is very good and i am satisfied	4,5; 8,9
do not buy this computer if your plan is to multitask , play an occasional game and / or play music while searching the web .	1,2
this is first impression , 1st day using it	6,7
overall good laptop .	1,2
the fingerprint scanner is half jotted and barely works .	7,8
one day of use and the screen turns itself off and logs you out whenever it feels to do so .	7,8
finger print scanner not working whatsoever .	3,4
with all the great spec hardware in this laptop , why would you put a 5400rpm hard drive in this unit ?	3,4
poor touch pad , it get stuck .	0,1; 6,7
- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine	5,6
- user interfaces that are tight , responsive	5,6; 7,8
all and all , it ' s a light weight , but very robust development stack , that also has the added convenience of cloud9 ' s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously .	8,9; 13,14; 21,22
thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well .	36,37
mouse and trackpad settings are very minimalist , there ' s no way to modify short - cut keys , and the power management options are pretty minimal , too .	12,13; 27,28
and the google play store is chock - full of great apps and games .	10,11
it ' s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different linux configs and environments effortless .	4,5; 6,7; 21,22
you won ' t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it , and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer .	8,9; 30,31; 32,33
for ~ $ 15 you can get a nice , fitted anti - glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint / glare problems and gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen .	8,9; 17,18; 33,34
i saw this c302 was announced at ces and was immediately drawn to it since it has the intel core m3 processor .	10,11
apps like microsoft word , excel , etc run wonderfully .	9,10
for instance , the android youtube app doesn ' t work well at all because it ' s very inconvenient to get videos into full - screen mode .	7,10; 19,20
it seems pretty fast .	3,4
so i ' m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302 .	5,6; 12,13
this is easily the best overall chromebook out there right now ( under $ 500 ) .	4,5
* battery * - battery life is great .	7,8
the backlight works great and i had no problems using it in the dark .	3,4
it ' s a nice smooth surface so no tension when gliding across it .	4,5
multi - touch input works great .	5,6
* build quality * - i ' m really pleased with the overall quality .	9,10
it ' s light enough to carry pretty much every where .	3,4
it starts up , runs without issues .	6,7
even the speakers are way better than i expected from a 2 in 1 at this price point .	5,6
this is finally the chromebook i ' ve been waiting for , that is not a $ 1300 pixel .	2,3; 6,8
- the screen has great contrast and is glossy and sharp	4,5; 10,11
- this may be a personal preference but i did wish the screen was a tad bit brighter .	6,7; 9,10; 13,14
overall great chromebook .	1,2
this is a spectacular chromebook .	3,4
it ' s faster , the screen is much nicer , and it has twice the memory and four times the drive space .	3,4; 8,9; 13,14
the core m3 processor allows the c302 to be fanless , as well , adding to the sleek design .	4,5; 9,10; 17,18
it ' s a real timesaver , honestly .	5,6(SPA)
i find the display sharp and touch responsive to be quite excellent .	4,5; 6,7; 11,12
at the end of the day i think it is worth the extra cost if you are looking for a premium product feel .	10,11
- nice , bright screen ( touchscreen , too ! )	1,2; 3,4
battery doesn ' t last nearly as long as advertised .	1,4
this is a very cleverly designed and fast machine .	4,5; 7,8
operational speed - - likely the fastest laptop i have ever used ( for basic functions ) .	6,7
edit 2 : 8 months in and everything is working great .	10,11
- trackpad isn ' t the best .	2,3
- the touch screen isn ' t as accurate as i wish , for cases like tapping tiny things around the edges .	4,7; 16,17
- the screen size is an awkward 16 : 9 and provides a 1920x1080 resolution ( although the default is set to 1536x864 ) .	6,7
for 99 % of the people looking at chromebooks right now for personal use , this asus is probably the best choice in the market .	20,21
overall , i am extremely impressed with this chromebook and would highly recommend this to others .	5,6; 11,12
it works well as a tablet .	1,2
it works great as a laptop and for the things i do which tend to be web based .	2,3
nevertheless , i did have my own nitpicking issues with it but for the $ 250 price tag it launched with , it was well worth it .	25,26
i found the display to be very vibrant , with excellent pixel density .	7,8; 10,11
i like the dispersion of ports and feel it helps with the ergonomics of your daily usage .	1,2; 9,10
still , for $ 450 i ' m a huge fan of the screen and the excellent overall build quality .	9,10; 16,17
and even with all of the new competition hitting the market with higher price points , the c302 still offers the best premium chrome os experience at a respectable price .	21,22
the screen is fantastic .	3,4
the mousepad feels very comfortable to use .	4,5
the battery performance is all it ' s cracked up to be .	2,3
the sound is rich and plenty loud enough , but it won ' t replace your music system .	3,4; 5,6; 11,14
backlit allow even guys with large hands to use this keyboard comfortably in any lighting .	0,1; 11,12
the trackpad and touchscreen are both excellent .	6,7
the speaker sound is ok but not great .	4,5
i really do love this chromebook because it provides a large amount of utility and is perfect for a university setting and environment .	3,4; 16,17
* the usb - c ports are working well , and i bought a multiple port adapter , which gives me a regular usb port along with a hdmi port an another usb - c port for charging .	8,9
speaker : good speakers but not the loudest .	2,3
the device is so sturdy and clean looking it is a pleasure to hold in my hands .	4,5; 6,7; 11,12
the touchscreen is very responsive and works great in tablet mode .	3,4; 7,8
the battery life is touted as 10 hours but i find that 7 .	4,5; 10,11
this is a fantastic chromebook .	3,4
- single battery charge can last 13 - 9 hours depending on wifi / video / app demand	10,11
i love this chromebook .	1,2
the touchscreen works very well , and android apps are working right now if you ' re on the beta channel for chrome os .	4,5
i love this chromebook !	1,2
/ / really love this device .	3,4
i really like the keyboard .	2,3
the only drawback to the device so far is that it ' s not especially comfortable to use in tablet mode ; the edges of the bezel are little too ` ` sharp ` ` to comfortably rest your palms and at 2 .	2,3; 13,14; 29,30
as a laptop , this is just the size i need .	10,11
the keyboard is often - praised , but i don ' t find it particularly spectacular .	3,4; 9,12
it is very light , and it seems surprisingly sturdy .	2,3; 9,10
the battery life seems just as promised .	6,7
the keyboard is comfortable to type on , although i haven ' t done so for more than a 1 - 2 hours .	3,4
the screen is clear and bright and the system doesn ' t lag unless i have a large number of tabs open .	3,4; 5,6; 9,12
first , use case : i write a lot for work and use a chromebook as my daily driver for notes , word processing , spreadsheets , etc .	8,9
battery last incredibly long .	3,4
it found and connected to my wireless printer also with no problems .	11,12
this is exactly what i wanted .	2,3
i now feel like this could be my main computer for work and fun .	13,14
give the asus flip 302 consideration .	5,6
its battery life is quite good and the keyboard experience is great .	5,6; 11,12
the plugs are good and bad .	5,6
i plugged in regular headphones and it was horribly low - very unenjoyable to listen to music this way .	1,2; 12,13
nice sized keyboard , works great as a tablet ( even shuts off the keyboard in tablet mode ) .	0,1; 5,6
this machine is far better than anything i ' ve ever owned .	4,5
perfect size to use in bed and nice and bright .	0,1; 7,8; 9,10
i don ' t think you ' ll find a better laptop at this price point .	1,4; 10,11
it ' s super thin and super light .	3,4; 6,7
as a traveler , this fits in my backpack without all the added weight of a small 13 ` ` laptop .	5,6
it is very light in weight but feels quite durable and strong .	3,4; 9,10; 11,12
the picture quality is very good and the book itself is responsive and fast .	5,6; 13,14
i can ' t recommend the asus c302 enough .	1,4
the keyboard itself is probably the one physical weak point .	8,9
the touchscreen works well .	2,3
but , it does work and is handy .	3,4; 6,7
it ' s very light and sitting on the couch typing this is comfortable .	4,5; 13,14
sound is really low while using an aux speaker / headphone .	2,3; 5,6
spacebar doesn ' t always accept input	1,4
this is my favorite computer of all the ones i have ever owned .	3,4
the battery life is stunning .	4,5
i ' ve just gotten started so this review may evolve over time but after several days i ' m insanely satisfied with this purchase and am going to be showing off to my friends for the foreseeable future .	21,22
this chromebook is one of the best computers i ' ve ever used .	6,7
the asus chromebook flip 302ca is smooth , fast and incredibly well engineered and built .	6,7; 8,9
the screen resolution is great .	4,5
the touch pad is accurate .	4,5
my only gripe is that i wish there was a way to default the screen brightness as well as default the keyboard backlight to off .	2,3; 24,25
at a $ 500 price tag for a chromebook i was a little hesitant to pull the trigger but at this point i am very pleased with the purchase and i believe it is worth the price .	13,14; 25,26; 34,35
it ' s really nice to have the touchscreen when using apps and i can seamlessly transition back to using the trackpad / keyboard depending on what i ' m doing .	4,5; 15,16
keyboard is comfortable and screen is sharp .	2,3; 6,7
its very portable and battery should last full day of normal usage .	2,3
i truly love this chromebook .	2,3
the touch screen is really accurate , and the 360 flip feature is really easy - i can switch to tablet mode anytime , although i use this much more often as a laptop .	5,6; 14,15; 26,27
the pros definitely outweigh the cons , earning this chromebook 5 stars .	3,4; 11,12
great computer , especially for the price .	0,1
- two usb - c for charging ( no more odd angles ! )	2,3(SPA)
- price is a bit expensive for a chromebook	5,6
it ' s perfect for school , surfing the web , and watching videos .	3,4

it feels and performs mighty solid as a laptop .	5,6
the wifi connectivity is strong and consistent in my experience .	4,5
the only thing i didn ' t like is the screen isn ' t bright enough and the speakers aren ' t louder .	2,3; 4,7; 11,14; 19,22
c302ca - dh54 gets the job done for work that doesn ' t require multiple cores for rendering , weight painting or ripping .	3,4
the graphics are great .	3,4
i ' m in college right new studying information technology and it ' s been able to do everything i ' ve needed .	15,16; 18,19(SPA)
it ' s a bit pricey for a chromebook but worth it right now .	10,11
the only drawback is that it does not run the native android versions of microsoft office , and they should warn you about that .	7,8; 20,21
this has met and exceeded my expectations .	4,5
this is a small , well built product ideal for general usage .	8,9
the screen resolution is also very good when watching movies or viewing photos .	6,7
i would highly recommend this !	2,3
i love the backlight , it ' s not so bright as to blind you at night time .	1,2
speaker ' s are ok but not amazing , i do like that they are mounted on the sides so they work well in laptop or tablet mode equally well .	7,8; 10,11; 21,22; 28,29
being able to use play store apps has been a huge plus and i ' m now so comfortable with google docs , i ' very already forgotten i even owned a windows laptop .	11,12; 18,19
but this screen is really good and the keyboard and form factor are much better .	5,6; 13,14
i really enjoy the 2 - 1 aspect of the device and really like how when folded into tablet mode , there aren ' t any weird groves on the sides .	2,3; 12,13
the computer itself is not bad , the 360 rotation and touch screen feel good .	14,15
battery life is amazing .	3,4
very good purchase .	1,2
in laptop form , it ' s mediocre at best .	7,8
this chromebook is really one of the best you can own , in my opinion one of the best laptops in general !	7,8; 18,19
the battery life is great and i love the touchscreen / flip feature .	4,5; 7,8
audio quest dragonfly is automatically detected and runs perfectly when attached to one of the usb - c ports .	8,9
the keyboard is backlit and big enough for my fingers .	6,7
i love everything about this laptop , the keyboard , screen resolution , and speed .	1,2
the battery lasts at least 8 - 9 hours using it to type notes and simple web browsing , making it perfect for students .	1,2; 21,22
it is quick , battery lasts a long time and certainly does what i need it to do ( which is web surfing multiple pages at the same time while having a few ms documents open ) .	2,3; 11,12
it ' s a clean , mean , lean , machine .	4,5
the switch has been awesome .	4,5
the backlit keyboard is awesome at night .	4,5
